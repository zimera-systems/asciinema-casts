# Asciinema Screencasts

This repo is used to store some [Asciinema screencasts by Zimera Systems](https://asciinema.org/~zimera). Mostly in Bahasa Indonesia, unless stated otherwise. We are happy users of [Fish Shell](https://www.fishshell.com), no wonder that our screencasts are based on Fish (unless stated otherwise, of course).

**Note**: To make things clear, in every screenscast we use something like "# bla bla bla". that's just an explanation, not part of screencast.
