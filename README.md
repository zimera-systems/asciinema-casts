# Asciinema-screencasts

This repo is used to store some Asciinema screencasts by Zimera Systems. Mostly in Bahasa Indonesia, unless stated otherwise. We are happy users of [Fish Shell](https://www.fishshell.com), no wonder that our screencasts are based on Fish (unless stated otherwise, of course).
